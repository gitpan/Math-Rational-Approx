=head1 NAME

Math::Rational::Approx - approximate a number with a rational number


=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Math::Rational::Approx ':all';

  #
  # find rational approximation with maximum denominator
  ($n, $d, $bounds ) = maxD( $x, 10 );

  # refine; note reuse of $bounds from previous call
  ( $n, $d ) = maxD( $x, 20, $bounds );


  #
  # find rational approximation to arbitrary precision using
  # continued fractions

  # one shot, 10 iterations
  ( $numerator, $denominator ) =
                   contfrac_nd( contfrac( 1.234871035, 10 ) );

  # multiple calls on same number; useful for convergence tests
  # keep array containing terms; get fraction and perhaps test it
  ( $terms, $residual ) = contfrac( 1.234871035, 3 );
  ( $n, $d ) = contfrac_nd( $terms  );

  # continue for an additional number of steps; note reuse of $terms;
  # new terms are appended to it
  ( $terms, $residual ) = contfrac( $residual, 3, $terms );

  # new results
  ( $n, $d ) = contfrac_nd( $terms );


=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module and its object oriented companion modules provide various
means for finding rational number approximations to real numbers.  The
object oriented versions are suitable when repeated refinements are
required.  See L<Math::Rational::Approx::MaxD> and L<Math::Rational::Approx::ContFrac>.



=head1 INTERFACE

=head2 Maximum denominator

B<maxD> finds the best rational approximation (n/d) to a fraction with
a denominator less than a given value.  It uses Farey's sequence and
is based upon the algorithm given at
L<http://www.johndcook.com/blog/2010/10/20/best-rational-approximation/>.

This is an iterative procedure, searching a given range for the
best approximation.   To enable further refinement, the
limiting denominator may by adjusted; the approximation
will be continued from the last calculation.

=over

=item maxD

  ( $n, $d, $bounds ) = maxD( $x, $maxD, );
  ( $n, $d, $bounds ) = maxD( $x, $maxD, $bounds );

Calculate the rational number approximation to C<$x> with denominator
no greater than C<$maxD>.

The optional argument, C<$bounds>, is a reference to a four element
array containing the initial bounds on the region to search.  It takes
the form

  bounds => [ a, b, c, d ]

where the elements are all non-negative integers and the bounds are
given by

  a/b < x < c/d
  b < maxD && d < maxD

The behavior is undefined if the latter condition is not yet, unless
the bounds are the result of a previous run of B<maxD>.

By default it searches from C<float(x)> to C<float(x)+1>.

B<maxD> returns the determined numerator and denominator as well as an
arrayref containing the bounds. If the C<$bounds> argument was
specified this is returned.

=back

=head2 Continued Fractions

To approximate using continued fractions, one first generates the
terms in the fraction using B<contfrac> and then calculates the
numerator and denominator using B<contfrac_nd>.

=over

=item contfrac

  ( $terms, $residual ) = contfrac( $x, $n );
  ( $terms, $residual ) = contfrac( $x, $n, $terms );

Generate C<$n> terms of the continous fraction representing
C<$x>. Additional terms may be added in subsequent calls
to B<contfrac> by passing C<$residual> as the number to approximate and
supplying the previous C<$terms> arrayref:

  ( $terms, $residual ) = contfrac( $x, 10 );
  ( $terms, $residual ) = contfrac( $residual, 3, $terms );


The arguments are as follows:

=over

=item $x

The number to approximate. It must be positive.

=item $n

The number of terms to generate.

=item $terms

I<Optional>.  An arrayref in which to store the terms.  The array is
appended to.

=back

Returns:

=over

=item $terms

An arrayref which holds the terms.  If one was provided in the
argument list it is passed through.

=item $residual

The residual of the input number as a B<Math::BigFloat> object.  This
is I<not> the difference between the input number and the rational
approximation.  It is suitable for reuse in subsequent calls to
B<contfrac>.

=back

=item contfrac_nd

  ( $nominator, $denominator ) = contfrac_nd( $terms );

Generate the nominator and denominator from the terms created by
B<contfrac>.  They are returned as B<Math::BigInt> objects.

=back
